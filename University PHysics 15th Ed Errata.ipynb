    "The stable answer would suggest a force present in the direction of the new position M from it's original position, which is not stated in the original question.   For no constant force acting on M the answer should be that it is unstable, since upon releasing M gravitational forces will act on M in an opposite direction from it's displacement.    Likewise in part i) any constant force acting on a stable system would make it unstable (ie: it will move, at least initially).  Also since gravitational forces decrease with distance any constant force acting perpendicular to M would cause this to change with the displacement distance, hence to place M in equilibrium a force would first need to act to displace M and then decrease to match the new gravitational forces from that point (ie: decrease).  Also because the distances between each of the other two masses and M is not equal nor is the mass, object M will  have a stronger gravitational pull towards one of the two masses (3m).  An force at a point perpendicular to M would therefore need to be acting at an angle from perpendicular to balance all the gravitational forces. "
